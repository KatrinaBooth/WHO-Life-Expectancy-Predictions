<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the continuous modelling section of the Predictive Modelling module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 2.5 days, I developed two linear regression models to predict life expectancy for each country between 2000 and 2015. The first model is designed to prioritize accuracy, while the second is simplified to focus on ethical considerations, particularly regarding the inclusion of features that may have financial implications for countries. Throughout the project, I balanced model complexity with accuracy, considering whether slight improvements in RMSE justify the inclusion of insignificant features that may add unnecessary complexity. The goal is to create trustworthy, ethically sound models that are sensitive to the data privacy concerns of individual countries.

The following deliverables were expected:

* Code, ideally broken down in relevant sections across multiple .ipynb files (EDA, Feature Engineering, Modelling, Testing)
* A final function, which must work by itself in an individual file (Single .ipynb file)
